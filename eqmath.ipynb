    "Javascript is used to calculate the distances, magnitudes and relative graphics sizes to confirm if it was an earthquake felt by the user. This repo contains the Javascript used in [WasThatAnEarthquake](https://wasthatanearthquake.net).  The purpose of the site is to determine if there was a perceptible earthquake in the last 15 minutes at the users location. There also a google map of the users location and all earthquakes of magnitude greater than 1.0 in the last 24 hours broken into three groups: \"Last 15 minutes\", \"Last hour\", \"Last day\".  Circles representing each earthquake have radii related to the magnitude of that particular event:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$radius = 2^{M-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where is M is the magnitude of the earthquake as reported by the USGS\n",
    "\n",
    "## Magnitudes\n",
    "\n",
    "An estimate of the magnitude at the users location for all earthquakes in the last 15 minutes is calculated using USGS's predicted distance attenuation (PDA) function.  The USGS provides PDAâ€™s for the eastern and western U.S. both are calculated and used as upper and lower bounds, respectively.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The upper bound or eastern U.S. equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$M_{eastern}\\ =\\ 1.60\\ +1.29*M\\ -\\ 0.00051*L - 2.16*log_{10}L$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where L the chordal distance between the user and the earthquake epicenter.  The lower bound or western U.S. equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$M_{western}\\ =\\ 1.15\\ +1.01*M\\ -\\ 0.00054*L - 1.72*log_{10}L$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chordal distances\n",
    "\n",
    "The chordal distance is calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L\\ = \\frac{R_{earth}}{1000.0}\\sqrt{2 * (1 - sin(\\theta_1) * sin(\\theta_2) * (cos(\\phi_1) * cos(\\phi_2) + sin(\\phi_1) * sin(\\phi_2)) - cos(|theta_1) * cos(\\theta_2)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\theta_1$ is the user's latitude (transformed):\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\theta_2\\ =\\ (90 - Latitude_{EQ})*\\frac{\\pi}{180.0},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\phi_1$ is the user's longitude:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi_1\\ =\\ (Longitude_{user} + 180)\\frac{\\pi}{180.0},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and $\\phi_2$ relates to the earthquake's epicenter's longitude:\n",
