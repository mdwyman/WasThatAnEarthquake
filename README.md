# WasThatAnEarthquake

This repo contains the Javascript used in [WasThatAnEarthquake](https://wasthatanearthquake.net).  The purpose of the site is to determine if there was a perceptible earthquake in the last 15 minutes at the users location. There also a google map of the users location and all earthquakes of magnitude greater than 1.0 in the last 24 hours broken into three groups: "Last 15 minutes", "Last hour", "Last day".  Circles representing each earthquake have radii related to the magnitude of that particular event.  Details on the math used can be found in the [eqmath](https://github.com/mdwyman/WasThatAnEarthquake/blob/master/eqmath.ipynb) python notebook in this repository
