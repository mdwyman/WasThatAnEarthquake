    "# WasThatAnEarthquake\n",
    "\n",
    "This repo contains the Javascript used in [WasThatAnEarthquake](https://wasthatanearthquake.net).  The purpose of the site is to determine if there was a perceptible earthquake in the last 15 minutes at the users location. There also a google map of the users location and all earthquakes of magnitude greater than 1.0 in the last 24 hours broken into three groups: \"Last 15 minutes\", \"Last hour\", \"Last day\".  Circles representing each earthquake have radii related to the magnitude of that particular event:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$radius = 2^{magnitude-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Magnitudes\n",
    "\n",
    "An estimate of the magnitude at the users location for all earthquakes in the last 15 minutes is calculated using USGS's predicted distance attenuation (PDA) function.  The USGS provides PDAâ€™s for the eastern and western U.S. both are calculated and used as upper and lower bounds, respectively.  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$M_{eastern}\\ =\\ 1.60\\ +1.29*M\\ -\\ 0.00051*L - 2.16*log_{10}L$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$M_{western}\\ =\\ 1.15\\ +1.01*M\\ -\\ 0.00054*L - 1.72*log_{10}L$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where M is the measured magnitude of the earthquake and L the chordal distance between the user and the earthquake epicenter.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Chordal distances\n",
    "\n",
    "The chordal distance is calculated:\n",
